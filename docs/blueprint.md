# **App Name**: Verdant Vista

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Mandatory login/registration gate that prevents non-logged-in users from viewing any site content.
- User Registration: New user registration process with admin approval workflow.
- Cannabis Page: A product gallery or listing page for all cannabis products.
- Merch Page: A product gallery or listing page for all merchandise.
- Cart Page: A page that displays items the user has added to their cart, with options to modify quantities or remove items.
- Checkout Process: When a user clicks the "Checkout" button on the Cart Page, the system should generate a summary of the cart's contents. This summary should be formatted for and exported to WhatsApp (e.g., by opening a new WhatsApp chat with a pre-filled message containing the order details). Simultaneously, the system must create an entry in a "checkout log" to record the event.
- User Management (Admin): Detail the full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for user accounts. Explain the function of the tri-state status icons. Propose a meaning for each color (e.g., Green: Approved/Active, Yellow: Pending Approval, Red: Banned/Deactivated).
- Product Management (Admin): Detail the CRUD operations for products (both cannabis and merch). Specify that this includes the ability to upload product images.
- Finance Dashboard (Admin): Describe the purpose of this dashboard as a central hub for financial oversight. List the key data points it should display, based on the user's notes: overall financials, a log of all checkouts, and total sales data.
- Inventory Management (Admin): Describe the functionality of this module for tracking product stock levels, which is essential for managing what is available for sale on the Cannabis and Merch pages.
