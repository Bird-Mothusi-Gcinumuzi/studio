Firebase Studio Implementation Specification: Zero-Cost Gated E-Commerce Platform
This specification is optimized for the Firebase "Spark" (Free) plan, strictly adhering to the generous usage limits (especially for a site capped at 300 users). The architecture minimizes expensive operations (such as frequent Cloud Function calls, excessive database writes, or large Storage usage) to ensure the system remains zero-cost.

Architecture Principle: Firebase Free Tier Optimization
Service	Free Tier Limit (Key Metrics)	Strategy for 300 Users
Authentication	50,000 MAU	Safe.
Firestore	50k Reads/day, 20k Writes/day	Very safe. Rely on efficient querying and indexing.
Cloud Functions	2 Million Invocations/month	Extremely safe. Used only for required server-side logic (checkout log).
Storage	5 GB Stored	Critical: Must optimize all product images (compression, WebP format) to stay under 5GB.
Hosting	Safe.	Use lightweight, client-side rendering frameworks.

Phase 1: Foundation and Zero-Cost Security


1.1 Core Security (Firebase Security Rules)
To maintain zero-cost security without complex backend logic, all access control must be enforced via granular Firestore Security Rules.

1.1.1. Default Site Access: Implement a rule blocking all read access to core data collections (products, checkouts) unless the user is authenticated AND their status field in their own user document is set to 'active'.
match /products/{document} { allow read: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.status == 'active'; }
1.1.2. Admin Access: Only users with the admin custom claim can write to the products or access the users collection for management.

1.2 User Data Model (Firestore)
The users collection remains the single source of truth for access status.

Collection	Required Fields	Status Mapping (Zero-Cost Focus)
users	email, name, status (String)	Green: 'active'; Yellow: 'pending'; Red: 'deactivated'
1.3 New User Registration Workflow
1.3.1. Minimal Write Trigger: Use the Cloud Function (onAuthCreate) trigger solely for the required single write operation: creating the users/{uid} document with status: 'pending'. This minimal function usage ensures low invocation costs.
1.3.2. Frontend Gate: The frontend reads the user's status once upon login. If status is not 'active', the user is denied access to all routes defined in the Security Rules.

Phase 2: Content and Image Optimization
2.1 Product Data Structure
The products collection design is finalized.

Field Name	Type	Note on Cost Efficiency
stockLevel	Number	Must be updated carefully (Phase 4.3) to avoid unnecessary writes.
imageUrl	String	MUST point to an optimized, compressed image in Storage.
2.2 Product Image Optimization (Storage Cost Control)
Since Storage space is limited (5GB free), image management is critical.

2.2.1. Image Format: All uploaded product images must be compressed and converted to modern formats like WebP before or during upload.
2.2.2. Manual Upload: Administrators should be educated to upload small, optimized images during product creation to conserve the 5GB quota.

2.3 Customer-Facing Pages
2.3.1. Firestore Listeners: Use real-time listeners on the products collection, filtered by category and stockLevel > 0. This efficient read pattern is well within the 50k read/day limit.

Phase 3: Zero-Cost Unique Checkout Flow
This process relies heavily on a single, efficient Cloud Function call per initiated checkout, keeping costs minimal.

3.1 Cloud Function: triggerCheckoutAndWhatsapp
This HTTPS Callable Function is the crucial zero-cost server-side component.

3.1.1. Input: uid, cartContents array.
3.1.2. Step 1: Single Firestore Write (Log): Perform the required write to the checkouts collection.
* Cost Optimization: This ensures the log is created with just one write operation, hitting the database only when strictly necessary.
3.1.3. Step 2: WhatsApp URL Generation: (As detailed previously) Construct the deep-link based on the user's cart and a target admin phone number.
3.1.4. Output: Return the generated WhatsApp URL to the client for redirection.

3.2 Finance Log Structure
The checkouts collection logs the intent to purchase.

Field Name	Type	Purpose
timestamp	Timestamp	Record of the log event.
userId	String	auth.uid of the user.
cartSnapshot	Map/JSON	Detailed list of products and quantities.
totalValue	Number	Calculated server-side (in the Cloud Function).

Phase 4: Administrative Panel (Direct Firestore Manipulation)
The Admin UI will be built as a high-privilege application that performs direct CRUD operations on Firestore, avoiding unnecessary intermediary API calls and simplifying the backend to ensure zero cost.

4.1 Security for Admin Panel
Ensure the Admin application component is protected by client-side checks and Server-Side Security Rules checking for the role: 'admin' Custom Claim, preventing unauthorized Firestore access.

4.2 User Management
UI Implementation: The Admin UI reads and writes directly to the users collection.
Approval Workflow: When an Admin changes a user's status to 'active', they must manually trigger a utility function that uses the Firebase Admin SDK (which can be hosted within a simple Cloud Function if necessary, or accessed via a privileged interface) to set the required Custom Claim (role: 'member') in Firebase Authentication.
4.3 Product and Inventory Management
4.3.1. CRUD: Admin interface performs direct CRUD on the products collection.
4.3.2. Inventory Updates: When an Admin changes the stockLevel, this results in a single, targeted update to the products/{id} document.

4.4 Finance Dashboard (Zero-Cost Aggregation)
Data Display: The dashboard is powered by real-time listeners and simple queries on the checkouts collection.
Aggregation: To calculate Total Potential Sales, the dashboard UI will perform the aggregation client-side using JavaScript/Front-End logic instead of relying on resource-intensive, billed services like scheduled Cloud Functions or complex multi-document queries. This shifts the computational cost from Google's servers to the administrator's browser, maintaining the zero-cost objective.
Log View: A simple, filterable table displays all documents in the checkouts collection (the "All Checkouts Log").
